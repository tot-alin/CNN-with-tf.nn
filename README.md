# Convolutional neural network 2D with module tf.nn

  This project aims at realizing a model based on 2D convolutional neural networks
using the tf.nn module in TensorFlow. The model has the ability to classify eight items
['airplane', 'car', 'cat', 'dog', 'flower', 'fruit', 'motorbike', 'person'] and has been trained with
6899 images. The description of this project is mainly focused on describing the
functionality of 2D convolutional neural networks. [CNN_tf_nn.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21197876/CNN_tf_nn.pdf)

## Elementary functions in the structure of CNN models
In most cases, CNN models contain at least three important elements, described below.
* CNN
* Pool
* Activate function


## Convolutional neural networks
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an advanced version of Artificial Neural
Networks (ANNs), mainly designed to extract features from matrix datasets. These types
of networks are used primarily to deal with video, audio, and text content databases. As
illustrated in Figure 1.1, the components of a simple 2-dimensional CNN are: input data
matrix, filter, and map.
