# Convolutional neural network 2D with module tf.nn

This project aims at realizing a model based on 2D convolutional neural networks
using the tf.nn module in TensorFlow. The model has the ability to classify eight items
['airplane', 'car', 'cat', 'dog', 'flower', 'fruit', 'motorbike', 'person'] and has been trained with
6899 images. The description of this project is mainly focused on describing the
functionality of 2D convolutional neural networks. [CNN_tf_nn.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21197876/CNN_tf_nn.pdf)
